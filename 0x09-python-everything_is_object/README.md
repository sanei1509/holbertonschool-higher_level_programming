# Test Driven Development

name of the project → ****# 0x09. Python - Everything is object****

let’s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects. ****-   Based on the requirements of each task,  **you should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first**, before you actually code anything****

> First interaction with Test Driven Development

## Learning Objetives**

At the end of this project, are expected to learn these concepts:

### General
-   Why Python programming is awesome
-   What’s an interactive test
-   Why tests are important
-   How to write Docstrings to create tests
-   How to write documentation for each module and function
-   What are the basic option flags to create tests
-   How to find edge cases

## Execution tests with this command:
